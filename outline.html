<p>Here are some notes about the technical details of using the Apophenia library in your development environment.</p>
<p><b> Header aggregation </b></p>
<p>If you put </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
#include &lt;apop.h&gt;
</pre></div><p> at the top of your file, then it will call virtually every header file you could need: gsl_matrix.h, gsl_blas.h, sqlite3.h, stdio.h, string.h, math.h, apophenia_all_of_them.h, et cetera. Of course, if you get `implicit declaration of...' then you will need to manually include something else. Bear in mind that every book on C will tell you this is bad form and you shouldn't do it.</p>
<p><b> Easier calling syntax</b></p>
<p>Several functions (but nowhere near all) allow optional named arguments to functions. For example: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="group__convenience__fns.html#ga44a77f5e6867c627fd313f3f6e252ff8">apop_vector_distance</a>(v1, v2); <span class="comment">//assumes Euclidean distance</span>

<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="liblinking"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('liblinkingd');swapFolder('liblinkingf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="liblinkingf" alt="pip"> Libraries</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="liblinkingd">
<p>Your best bet is to write yourself a <a class="el" href="makefile.html">Makefile</a>. If you don't want to use the sample <a class="el" href="makefile.html">Makefile</a>, then here are some notes for the command line. When compiling, you will need to tell the compiler to use the Apophenia library. That is, you will need to call GCC with <code>gcc -lapophenia</code> (as well as the other usual flags). For example, <code> gcc sample.c -lapophenia -lsqlite3 -lgsl -lgslcblas -o run_me -g </code> will produce an output file named <code>run_me</code> from the input source code <code>sample.c</code>. It will include symbols for debugging (<code>-g</code>) and will correctly find the functions in the Apophenia, GSL, and SQLite libraries (<code>-lapophenia -lgsl ...</code>). Order matters in the linking list: the files a package depends on should be listed after the package. E.g., since sample.c depends on Apophenia, <code>gcc sample.c -lapophenia</code> will work, while <code>gcc -lapophenia sample.c</code> is likely to give you errors. Similarly, list <code>-lapophenia</code> before <code>-lgsl</code>, which comes before <code>-lgslcblas</code>.</p>
<p></div>
<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="debugging"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('debuggingd');swapFolder('debuggingf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="debuggingf" alt="pip"> Debugging</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="debuggingd">
<p>The global variable <code>apop_opts.verbose</code> turns on some diagnostics, such as printing the query sent to the database engine (which is useful if you are substituting in many <code>%s</code>es). There are several levels to the verbosity:</p>
<p>-1: silent <br/>
 0: notify only of failures and clear danger <br/>
 1: warn of technically correct but odd situations that might indicate, e.g., numeric instability <br/>
 2: debugging-type information; print queries <br/>
 3: give me everything</p>
<p>These levels are of course subjective, but should give you some idea of where to place the verbosity level. The default is 1.</p>
<p>The global variable <code>apop_opts.stop_on_warning</code> turns any warning into a halt via <code>abort()</code>. Use this to get your debugger to stop on the warning. If the verbosity level is too low to show the warning, the halt happens anyway.</p>
<p>If you use <code>gdb</code>, you can define macros to use the pretty-printing functions on your data, which can be a significant help. Add these to your <code></code>.gdbinit: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">define pv

<p>If your text editor supports syntax highlighting, there are a few types defined in the Apophenia and GSL headers which may be worth coloring. E.g., for <code>vim</code>, add the following two lines to <code>/usr/share/vim/syntax/c.vim</code>: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
syn keyword     cType           gsl_matrix gsl_rng gsl_vector apop_data

<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="python"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('pythond');swapFolder('pythonf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="pythonf" alt="pip"> The Python interface</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="pythond">
<p>The distribution includes a Python interface via the SWIG tool for bridging across languages.</p>
<p>Installation: You will need to have the SWIG and Python-development packages installed on your computer when compiling. From there, </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">./configure --enable-python
make
sudo make install
</pre></div><p> will produce the Python library and install it in Python's site-packages directory.</p>
<p>Sample script:</p>
<p>On the page on the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga85524b1deabd5829227888fd91740cc3">apop_ols</a> model, you will find a few lines of toy data and a sample program to run an OLS regression. Once you have set up the <code>data</code> file, you can use this Python rewrite of the OLS program:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">from apop <span class="keyword">import</span> *
apop_text_to_db(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;data&quot;</span>, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;d&quot;</span>, 0, 1, <span class="keywordtype">None</span>)
data = apop_query_to_data(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;select * from d&quot;</span>)
est  = apop_estimate(data, avar.apop_ols)
<span class="keywordflow">print</span> est

<span class="comment">#And one last example of using a method of the apop_data object:</span>

<span class="keywordflow">print</span> est.parameters.transpose()
</pre></div><ul>
<li>SWIG sets all C-side global variables into a category named avar. Thus the <code>apop_ols</code> variable had to be called <code>avar.apop_ols</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The verbose package-object-action scheme for naming functions is mostly unnecessary in Python, where objects can more closely be attached to functions. Thus, instead of calling <code>apop_vector_skew(my_v)</code>, you would call <code>my_v.skew()</code>. If you want a list of methods, just use <code>help(my_v)</code> or any of the other familiar means of introspection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another simple example, that copies a Python-side list into a matrix using <code>apop_pylist_to_data</code>, and then runs a Fisher Exact test on the matrix. If the list were one-dimensional (flat), then the data would be copied into the vector element of the returned <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> structure.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">from</span> apop <span class="keyword">import</span> *
data = [[15, 13], [18, 19]]
adata = apop_pylist_to_data(data) 

<span class="keywordflow">print</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;display the data&quot;</span>
<span class="keywordflow">print</span> adata.matrix

result = apop_test_fisher_exact(adata)
<span class="keywordflow">print</span> result

<span class="keywordflow">print</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;Or, just one value:&quot;</span>
<span class="keywordflow">print</span> result.get(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;p value&quot;</span>, -1)
</pre></div><ul>
<li>The focus of the work is still in C, so there will likely always be things that you can do in C that can't be done in Python, and strange Python-side errors that will only be explicable if you understand the C-side. That said, you can still access all of the functions from Python (including those that make little sense from Python).</li>
</ul>

<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="About"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('Aboutd');swapFolder('Aboutf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="Aboutf" alt="pip"> SQL, the syntax for querying databases</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="Aboutd">
<p>For a reference, your best bet is the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html">Structured Query Language reference</a> for SQLite. For a tutorial; there is an abundance of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sql+tutorial">tutorials online</a>. The blog of Apophenia's author includes an <a href="http://fluff.info/blog/arch/00000118.htm">entry</a> about complementaries between SQL and matrix manipulation packages.</p>
<p>Apophenia currently supports two database engines: SQLite and mySQL. SQLite is the default, because it is simpler and generally more easygoing than mySQL, and supports in-memory databases.</p>
<p>You can switch to mySQL two ways: set <code>apop_opts.db_engine = 'm'</code>, or set the environment variable <code>APOP_DB_ENGINE=mysql</code>. Otherwise, the system will use SQLite. Ideally, after you make this switch, you need make no other changes--- <a class="el" href="group__queries.html#ga236452b3305ea7b791c781d91a819e3b">apop_query</a>, <a class="el" href="group__queries.html#gade862993166c6482f53562fb77721db9">apop_query_to_data</a>, <a class="el" href="db_8h.html#a01d501ca84ade92bc72fd4f67a617f64">apop_table_exists</a>, et cetera, will work as before.</p>
<p>Finally, Apophenia provides a few nonstandard SQL functions to facilitate math via database; see <a class="el" href="db_moments.html">Database moments (plus pow()!)</a>. </div>

<p>Apophenia co-evolved with <em>Modeling with Data: Tools and Techniques for Statistical Computing</em>. You can read about the book, or download a free PDF copy of the full text, at <a href="http://modelingwithdata.org">modelingwithdata.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are at this site, there is probably something there for you, including a tutorial on C and general computing form, SQL for data-handing, several chapters of statistics from various perspectives, and more details on working Apophenia.</p>

<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="status"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('statusd');swapFolder('statusf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="statusf" alt="pip"> What is the status of the code?</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="statusd">
<p>[This section last updated 21 February 2011.]</p>
<p>Apophenia was first posted to SourceForge in February 2005, which means that we've had several years to develop and test the code in real-world applications.</p>
<p>It is currently at version 0.99, which is intended to indicate that it is substantially complete. Of course, a library for scientific computing, or even for that small subset that is statistics, will never cover all needs and all methods. But as it stands Apophenia's framework, based on the <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> and <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a>, is basicaly internally consistent, has enough tools that you can get common work done quickly, and is reasonably fleshed out with a good number of models out of the box.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> structure is set, and there are enough functions there that you could use it as a subpackage by itself (along with the database functions) for nontrivial dealings with data.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> structure is much more ambitious, and although its interface is set (pending your comments and feedback), its internal system can still be improved. The promise underlying the structure is that you can provide just one item, such as an RNG or a likelihood function, and the structure will do all of the work to fill in computationally-intensive methods for everything else. Some directions aren't quite there yet (such as RNG -&gt; most other things); the default likelihood -&gt; RNG function only works for models with a domain of unidimensional reals; the PMF model (the essential bridge from data sets to empirical models) needs an internal index for faster lookups.</p>
<p>Which parts of the code are most reliable? There are vigorous tests on the code base, which currently cover about 73% of the lines of code; most of the untested part is in methods of some of the more obscure models. A broad rule of thumb for any code base is that the well-worn parts, in this case functions like <a class="el" href="group__data__set__get.html#gae3c2f0d4bd96555e8eeb32a44511d0ac">apop_data_get</a> and <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga297c2dc8dbdf4ae93fc7e10860400466">apop_normal</a>'s <code>log_likelihood</code>, are likely to be entirely reliable, while the out-of-the-way functions (maybe the RNG for the Yule distribution) are worth a bit of caution. Close to all of the code has been used in production, so all of it was at least initially tested against real-world data.</p>
<p></div>
<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="status"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('statusd');swapFolder('statusf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="statusf" alt="pip"> How do I write extensions?</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="statusd">
<p>It's not a package, so you don't need an API---write your code and #include it like any other C code. The system is explicity written to not require a registration or initialization step to add a new model or other such parts. You can read the notes below on generating new models, which have to conform to some rules if they are to play well with <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga0a3be4075a89f7119be95a4718e01ade">apop_estimate</a>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gaca737ed521192a76a307bbf825ab4a97">apop_draw</a>, and so forth.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to send new models or functions to the maintainer, or send the maintainer a URL if you prefer to host the code yourself; I'm happy to add references in the appropriate places.</p>

<p><h2><a class="anchor" name="dataoverview"><div class="trigger" onClick="showBranch('dataoverviewd');swapFolder('dataoverviewf')"><img src="right.png" border="0" id="dataoverviewf" alt="pip"> Data sets</div></a></h2><div class="branch" id="dataoverviewd">
<p>The <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> structure represents a data set. It joins together a <code>gsl_vector</code>, a <code>gsl_matrix</code>, an <a class="el" href="structapop__name.html">apop_name</a>, and a table of strings. It tries to be lightweight, so you can use it everywhere you would use a <code>gsl_matrix</code> or a <code>gsl_vector</code>.</p>
<p>For example, let us say that you are running a regression: there is a vector for the one dependent variable, and a matrix for the several independent variables. Think of them as a partitioned matrix, where the vector is column -1, and the first column of the matrix is column zero. Here is some code to print the entire matrix. Notice that the column counter <code>i</code> starts counting at -1.</p>

    printf(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;\n&quot;</span>);
    }
</pre></div><p>We're generally assuming that the data vector and data matrix have the same row count: <code>data-&gt;vector-&gt;size==data-&gt;matrix-&gt;size1</code> . This means that the <a class="el" href="structapop__name.html">apop_name</a> structure doesn't have separate vector_names and row_names elements: the rownames are assumed to apply for both.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> set includes a <code>more</code> pointer, which will typically be <code>NULL</code>, but may point to another <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> set. This is intended for a main data set and a second or third page with auxiliary information: estimated parameters on the front page and their covariance matrix on page two, or predicted data on the front page and a set of prediction intervals on page two. <code>apop_data_copy</code> and <code>apop_data_free</code> will handle all the pages of information. The <code>more</code> pointer is not intended as a linked list for millions of data points---you can probably find a way to restructure your data to use a single table (perhaps via <a class="el" href="group__conversions.html#ga7e31798ab418cbfc7488eaba27dad2af">apop_data_pack</a> and <a class="el" href="group__conversions.html#gae3058b7f39d0442f13284464d1ba235d">apop_data_unpack</a>).</p>
<p>Easy data manipulation is essential for enjoying life as a researcher. Thus, there are a great many functions to collate, copy, merge, sort, prune, and otherwise manipulate the <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> structure and its components.</p>

<p>Note: Apophenia builds upon the GSL, but it would be inappropriate to redundantly replicate the GSL's documentation here. You will find a link to the full GSL documentation at the end of this outline, and the text of the outline will list the names a few common functions. The GSL's naming scheme is very consistent, so a simple reminder of the function name may be sufficient for your needs.</p>

<p>These macros make use of a set of GSL matrices that produce output of type <code>gsl_matrix_view</code> and <code>gsl_vector_view</code>. These types point to the source data, and add metadata to turn the data into a coherent matrix/vector. Apophenia's macros generate these views, then pull the matrix/vector from them, so you never have to deal with the <code>_view</code> structs directly.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="stats_8h.html#a922aeef48df4a7fcc78831719212726c">Apop_data_rows</a> and <a class="el" href="stats_8h.html#a2a1bc770d6631e85359acb8b665439b3">Apop_data_row</a> macros are intended to be a view of one or more rows of an <a class="el" href="gentle.html#apop_data">apop_data</a> set.</p>
<p>If the macros don't work for you, you can use the GSL's macros directly. Here's how to get the fifth row of <code>a_matrix</code> into a vector view:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">gsl_vector_view v;
v = gsl_matrix_col(a_matrix, 4);
</pre></div><p>For rows, use <code>gsl_matrix_row(a_matrix, n)</code>. The vector view is a data structure which includes an element of type <code>gsl_vector</code> named <code>vector</code>; this is the only element you will be interested in. The expression <code>&amp;(v.vector)</code> is of type <code>gsl_vector *</code>, and therefore can be used as you would any other pointer to a <code>gsl_vector</code>. For example, try <a class="el" href="group__vector__moments.html#ga0f69c8414f1d93fa15f3a631710dcd7a">apop_mean</a><code>(&amp;(v.vector));</code>.</p>
<p>The view is intended to be a common variable, not a pointer. If you want to retain the data after the function exits, copy it to another vector: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">gsl_vector_view v;
gsl_vector *a_new_vector = gsl_vector_alloc(a_matrix-&gt;size1);
v = gsl_matrix_col(a_matrix, 4);
gsl_vector_memcpy(a_new_vector, &amp;(v.vector));
</pre></div><p>What would happen if you return <code>&amp;(v.vector)</code> to a calling function? The calling function now has a pointer to the space where <code>v.vector</code> had been, but because <code>v</code> is an automatically allocated variable, that address may now hold garbage.</p>
<p>One more reminder: curly braces delimit scope. These macros work by generating a number of local variables, which you may be able to see in your debugger. When program evaluation exits a given block, all variables in that block are erased. Here is some sample code that won't work: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keywordflow">if</span> (get_odd){
    <a class="code" href="stats_8h.html#a2a1bc770d6631e85359acb8b665439b3">Apop_data_row</a>(data, 1, outdata);

</pre></div><p>For this if/then statement, there are two sets of local variables generated: one for the <code>if</code> block, and one for the <code>then</code> block. By the last line, neither exists. You can get around the problem here by making sure to not put the macro declaring new variables in a block. E.g.:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="stats_8h.html#a2a1bc770d6631e85359acb8b665439b3">Apop_data_row</a>(data, get_odd ? 1 : 0, outdata);

</pre></div><p>Apophenia ships with many well-known models for your immediate use, including probability distributions, such as the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga297c2dc8dbdf4ae93fc7e10860400466">apop_normal</a>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga9c67838a4761452cc2c9113557f2a070">apop_poisson</a>, or <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gac11decb2971532ada7d2cd4982848b90">apop_beta</a> models. The data is assumed to have been drawn from a given distribution and the question is only what distributional parameters best fit; e.g., assume the data is Normally distributed and find the mean and variance: <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga0a3be4075a89f7119be95a4718e01ade">apop_estimate</a>(<code>your_data</code>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga297c2dc8dbdf4ae93fc7e10860400466">apop_normal</a>).</p>
<p>There are also linear models like <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga85524b1deabd5829227888fd91740cc3">apop_ols</a>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga319b8e3d5025a6fc94829a978273eb8b">apop_probit</a>, and <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gaa88a402cf7d02c25c4613a74ace1b0c1">apop_logit</a> (where those last two are multinomial or binomial as the input data dictates). As in the example, they are on equal footing with the distributions, so nothing keeps you from making random draws from an estimated linear model.</p>
<p>Simulation models seem to not fit this form, but you will see below that if you can write an objective function for the <code>p</code> method of the model, you can use the above tools. Notably, you can estimate parameters via maximum likelihood and then give confidence intervals around those parameters.</p>
<p>But some models have to break uniformity, like how a histogram has a list of bins that makes no sense for a Normal distribution. These are held in <em>settings groups</em>, which you will occasionally need to tweak to modify how a model is handled or estimated. The most common example would be for maximum likelihood,</p>

<p>As above, users are encouraged to always interrogate models via the helper functions, like <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga0a3be4075a89f7119be95a4718e01ade">apop_estimate</a> or <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gaee16258d3e52671e254f3ce03bca7754">apop_cdf</a>. The helper functions do some boilerplate error checking, and are where the defaults are called: if your model has a <code>log_likelihood</code> method but no <code>p</code> method, then <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga2510c7df8ccd834732ee208005738b0f">apop_p</a> will use exp(<code>log_likelihood</code>). If you don't give an <code>estimate</code> method, then <code>apop_estimate</code> will call <a class="el" href="group__mle.html#ga29975e75eec9ff9f48e836971a32c925">apop_maximum_likelihood</a>.</p>
<p>So the game in writing a new model is to write just enough internal methods to give the helper functions what they need. In the not-uncommon best case, all you need to do is write a log likelihood function, and the model framework described to this point gets filled in via defaults.</p>
<p>Here is how one would set up a model that could be estimated using maximum likelihood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a likelihood function. Its header will look like this: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keywordtype">double</span> apop_new_log_likelihood(<a class="code" href="struct__apop__data.html">apop_data</a> *data, <a class="code" href="struct__apop__model.html">apop_model</a> *m)
</pre></div> where <code>data</code> is the input data, and <code>m</code> is the parametrized model (i.e. your model with a <code>parameters</code> element set by the caller). This function will return the value of the log likelihood function at the given parameters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is this a constrained optimization? See below under Maximum likelihood methods <img class="formulaInl" alt="$->$" src="form_86.png"/> Setting constraints on how to set them. Otherwise, no constraints will be assumed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write the object. In your header file, include <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="struct__apop__model.html">apop_model</a> your_new_model = {<span class="stringliteral">&quot;The Me distribution&quot;</span>, 
            .vbase=n0, .mbase1=n1, .mbase2=n2, .dbase=nd,
            .estimate = new_estimate, .log_likelihood = new_log_likelihood };
</pre></div> If there are constraints, add an element for those too.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameter counts are needed for procedures that auto-allocate the parameters; for the above example, they will call <code>newest-&gt;parameters = apop_data_alloc(n0, n1, n2)</code>. The <code>dbase</code> is the size of a data element, and is needed to let those methods that make random draws internally know how much space to allocate. It's common to have [(the number of columns in your data set) -1] parameters; this count will be filled in if you specify <code>-1</code> for <code>vbase</code> or <code>mbase(1|2)</code>. If the allocation is exceptional in a different way, then you will need to allocate parameters via a <code>prep</code> method.</p>
<p>You already have enough that something like </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="struct__apop__model.html">apop_model</a> *estimated = apop_mle(your_data, your_new_model);
</pre></div><p> will work.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are definitely using a maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters, you can get much faster estimates and better covariance estimates by specifying the dlog likelihood function (aka the score): <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> apop_new_dlog_likelihood(<a class="code" href="struct__apop__data.html">apop_data</a> *d, gsl_vector *gradient, <a class="code" href="struct__apop__model.html">apop_model</a> *m){
    <span class="comment">//some algebra here to find df/dp0, df/dp1, df/dp2....</span>
    gsl_vector_set(gradient,0, d_0);
    gsl_vector_set(gradient,1, d_1);
}
</pre></div> Because this is just for max. likelihood, it is clearly optional.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>From there, everything else is optional. The random number generator for a unidimensional case is filled in via adaptive-rejection sampling, there is a default print and prep, et cetera. You can improve upon the defaults as your time allows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> is mostly functions, with few standard-across-models data elements. If your functions carry around specific data, then you will have to write a companion structure and read the instructions on initializing/copying/freeing settings groups below.</p>

<p>Describing a statistical, agent-based, social, or physical model in a standardized form is difficult because every model has significantly different settings. E.g., an MLE requires a method of search (conjugate gradient, simplex, simulated annealing), and a histogram needs the number of slots to be filled with data.</p>
<p>So, the <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> includes a single list which can hold an arbitrary number of groups of settings, like the search specifications for finding the maximum likelihood, a histogram for making random draws, and options about the model type.</p>
<p>Settings groups are automatically initialized with default values when needed. If the defaults do no harm, then you don't need to think about these settings groups at all.</p>
<p>Here is an example where a settings group is worth tweaking: the <a class="el" href="structapop__parts__wanted__settings.html">apop_parts_wanted_settings</a> group indicates which parts of the auxiliary data you want.</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">1 <a class="code" href="struct__apop__model.html">apop_model</a> *m = <a class="code" href="group__models.html#ga14f2bd54421fd6629baccb8a41ecd304">apop_model_copy</a>(<a class="code" href="group__models.html#ga85524b1deabd5829227888fd91740cc3">apop_ols</a>);

</pre></div><p>Line one establishes the baseline form of the model. Line two adds a settings group of type <a class="el" href="structapop__parts__wanted__settings.html">apop_parts_wanted_settings</a> to the model. By default other auxiliary items, like the expected values, are set to <code>'n'</code> when using this group, so this specifies that we want covariance and only covariance. Having stated our preferences, line three does the estimation we want.</p>
<p>Notice that we don't need the <code>_settings</code> ending to the settings group's name---macros make it happen. <code>Apop_model_add_group</code> follows the <a class="el" href="designated.html">Designated initializers</a> syntax of the form <code>.setting=value</code>.</p>
<p>Settings groups are copied with the model, which facilitates chaining estimations. Continuing the above example, you could re-estimate to get the predicted values and covariance via:</p>

<p>First, there's a lightweight method of storing sundry settings, so in many cases you can bypass all of the following. The <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> structure has a <code>void</code> pointer named <code>more</code> which you can use to store extra information as needed. If <code>more_size</code> is larger than zero (i.e. you set it to <code>your_model.more_size=sizeof(your_struct)</code>), then it will be copied via <code>memcpy</code> by <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga14f2bd54421fd6629baccb8a41ecd304">apop_model_copy</a>, and <code>free</code>d by <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gab29755a86b82dfe31cdd01d55431cc09">apop_model_free</a>. Apophenia's estimation routines will never impinge on this item, so do what you feel with it.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the information you'll have to provide to make use of the conveniences described to this point: initialization of defaults, smarter copying and freeing, and adding to an arbitrariy long list of settings groups attached to a model. You will need four items: the structure itself, plus init, copy, and free functions. This is the sort of boilerplate that will be familiar to users of object oriented languages in the style of C++ or Java, but it's really a list of arbitrarily-typed elements, which makes this feel more like LISP. [And being a reimplementation of an existing feature of LISP, this section will be macro-heavy.]</p>
<ul>
<li>The settings struct will likely go into a header file, so here is a sample header for a new settings group named <code>ysg_settings</code> (Your Settings Group), with a dataset, its two sizes, and an owner-of-data marker: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct </span>{
    <span class="keywordtype">int</span> size1, size2, owner;
    <a class="code" href="struct__apop__data.html">apop_data</a> *dataset;
} ysg_settings;

Apop_settings_declarations(ysg)
</pre></div> The first item is a familiar structure definition. The last line is a macro that declares the three functions below. This is everything you would need in a header file, should you need one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure itself gets the full name, <code>ysg_settings</code>. Everything else is a macro, and so you need only specify <code>ysg</code>, and the <code>_settings</code> part is implied. Because of these macros, your <code>struct</code> name must end in <code>_settings</code>.</p>
<p>If you have an especially simple structure, then you can declare the three functions with these three macros in your code:</p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#aefe030e4bba4671d8b026e81be70f764">Apop_settings_init</a>(ysg, )
<a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#a47600802191d9ccf5d48fce70e754294">Apop_settings_copy</a>(ysg, )
<a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#a833e962fb042462eeadada7484671f07">Apop_settings_free</a>(ysg, )
</pre></div><p>These macros generate appropriate functions to do what you'd expect: allocating the main structure, copying one struct to another, freeing the main structure. The spaces after the commas indicate that no special code gets added to the functions that these macros generate.</p>
<p>Now that initializing/copying/freeing of the structure itself is handled, the remainder of this section will be about how to add instructions for the struture internals, like data that is pointed to by the structure elements.</p>
<p>You'll never call these funtions directly; they are called by <a class="el" href="group__settings.html#ga553b02de4ace5e6f16a8b26da777f9b9">Apop_model_add_group</a>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gab29755a86b82dfe31cdd01d55431cc09">apop_model_free</a>, and other model or settings-group handling functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the allocate function, use the above form if everything in your code defaults to zero/<code>NULL</code>. In most cases, though, you will need a new line declaring a default for every element in your structure. There is a macro to help with this too. These macros will define for your use a structure named <code>in</code>, and an output pointer-to-struct named <code>out</code>. Continuing the above example: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#aefe030e4bba4671d8b026e81be70f764">Apop_settings_init</a> (ysg, 
      <a class="code" href="asst_8h.html#aa6760fa3f2e261b93aaf25d80a11375c">Apop_assert</a>(in.size1, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;I need you to give me a value for size1. Stopping.&quot;</span>);
      Apop_varad_set(size2, 10);
      Apop_varad_set(dataset, <a class="code" href="apop__data_8c.html#ac39d6a56933b6f084328ec5ecd5090d8">apop_data_alloc</a>(out-&gt;size1, out-&gt;size2));
      Apop_varad_set(owner, 1);
)
</pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <code>Apop_settings_add(a_model, ysg, .size1=100)</code> would set up a group with a 100-by-10 data set, and set the owner bit to one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some functions do extensive internal copying, so you will need a copy function even if you don't do any explicit calls to <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga14f2bd54421fd6629baccb8a41ecd304">apop_model_copy</a>. The default above simply copies every element in the structure. Pointers are copied, giving you two pointers pointing to the same data. We have to be careful to prevent double-freeing later. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="comment">//alternative one: mark that the copy doesn&#39;t own the data.</span>
<span class="comment">//From the defaults, out-&gt;dataset is a copy of the in-&gt;dataset pointer.</span>

        out-&gt;owner = 0;
)

<span class="comment">//alternative two: just copy the data. </span>
<span class="comment">//owner will be 1, a value copied from the original.</span>
<a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#a47600802191d9ccf5d48fce70e754294">Apop_settings_copy</a> (ysg,
        out-&gt;dataset = <a class="code" href="apop__data_8c.html#add67e6838ce2521a1d756894dc9b5ccf">apop_data_copy</a>(in-&gt;dataset);
)
</pre></div></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add code in the free function to free data pointed to by pointers in the main struture. The macro defines a pointer-to-struct named <code>in</code> for your use. Continuing the example (for either copying alternative): <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="settings_8h.html#a833e962fb042462eeadada7484671f07">Apop_settings_free</a> (ysg,
    <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (in-&gt;owner)
        free(in-&gt;dataset);
)
</pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>With those three macros in place, Apophenia will treat your settings group like any other.</p>

<p>You might want to clean up the data before turning it into a PMF. For example...</p>

Compression produces a corresponding improvement in efficiency when calculating CDFs or making draws. Sorting is not necessary for making draws or getting a likelihood or log likelihood.</p>
<p>It is the weights vector that holds the density represented by each row; the rest of the row represents the coordinates of that density. If the input data set has no <code>weights</code> segment, then I assume that all rows have equal weight. So, for example, if you find a need to normalize the data into a sums-to-one PMF, then you can use <a class="el" href="stats_8h.html#a194ad92b1bc632ba1d13d9958c7b5b4d">apop_vector_normalize</a> on the <code>weights</code> vector to implement that. [But notice that even the PMF's <code>draw</code> function doesn't need this.]</p>
<p>Using <a class="el" href="asst_8h.html#acc90578a8086a2e6f7b1575300260f08">apop_data_pmf_compress</a> puts the data into one bin for each unique value in the data set. You may instead want bins of fixed with, in the style of a histogram. A binspec has as many columns as the data set being binned, and has one or two rows. The first row gives a bin width for the given column, so each column may have a different bin width. The second row, if present, gives the offset from zero for the bins. All bins, both above and below zero, are shifted accordingly. If there is no second row, the offset is zero.</p>
<p>Send this binspec to <a class="el" href="asst_8h.html#a02cef4243593cf905fa54cb48d8b04c2">apop_data_to_bins</a>. If you send a <code>NULL</code> binspec, then the offset is zero and the bin size is big enough to ensure that there are <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\sqrt(N)$" src="form_16.png"/> bins from minimum to maximum. There are other preferred formulae for bin widths that minimize MSE, which might be added as a future extension. The binspec will be added as a page to the data set, named <code>"&lt;binspec&gt;"</code></p>
<p>There are a few ways of testing the claim that one distribution equals another, typically an empirical PMF versus a smooth theoretical distribution. In both cases, you will need two distributions based on the same binspec.</p>
<p>For example, if you do not have a prior binspec in mind, then you can use the one generaged by the first call to the histogram binning function to make sure that the second data set is in sync:</p>

<p>The GSL provides a <code>gsl_histogram</code> structure, that produces a PDF by accumulating data into bins. Apophenia wraps this into its <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> struct, so that the model-family machinery can be applied to Bayesian updating, kernel smoothing, or other methods that could take in a PDF. To produce a GSL histogram-based PMF from <code>your_data</code>, use <a class="el" href="group__models.html#ga0a3be4075a89f7119be95a4718e01ade">apop_estimate</a>(<code>your_data</code>, <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gafa54b2573ed0868774a9a78d07d07e62">apop_histogram</a>).</p>
<p>The GSL histogram is one-dimensional. The GSL also provides a two-dimensional version, but this is still short of the <img class="formulaInl" alt="$N$" src="form_3.png"/> dimensions of the typical data set. Also, especially for larger dimensions, we need a sparse representation, while the GSL histogram structure choses the speed of a complete representation over the scalability of a sparse representation. For these and a few technical reasons, the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gafa54b2573ed0868774a9a78d07d07e62">apop_histogram</a> model is considered to be deprecated---for most purposes, you are better off using the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gaca8f3323c57e0223a9f3c0f991c9760e">apop_pmf</a>, which is at this point better supported.</p>
<p>As an aside, the GSL provides a closely-related second structure that incrementally sums up the PMF's bins to produce a CMF. The CMF can be used to map from a draw from a Uniform[0,1] to a draw from the PMF. Because it can be used to draw from the PMF, the GSL calls this the <code>gsl_histogram_pdf</code> structure. That's right: the data in the <code>gsl_histogram_pdf</code> structure is a cumulative sum---a CMF. This is handled internally by the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gafa54b2573ed0868774a9a78d07d07e62">apop_histogram</a>, but you can retrieve it if need be.</p>
<p>As with the <a class="el" href="group__models.html#gaca8f3323c57e0223a9f3c0f991c9760e">apop_pmf</a>, if you want to compare this histogram to other data (observed or theoretical), then you'll need to produce a second synced histogram.

<p>This section includes some notes on the maximum likelihood routine, but if you read the section on writing models, then you already know how to do maximum likelihood on exotic setups. Just write a model that has a <code>p</code> or <code>log_likelihood</code> function, and call <code>apop_estimate(your_data,your_model)</code>. The default estimation routine is maximum likelihood.</p>
<p>If you are a not a statistician, then there are a few things you will need to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physicists, pure mathematicians, and the GSL minimize; economists, statisticians, and Apophenia maximize. If you are doing a minimization, be sure that your function returns minus the objective function's value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The overall setup is about estimating the parameters of a model with data. The user provides a data set and an unparameterized model, and the system tries parameterized models until one of them is found to be optimal. The data is fixed---it was observed before the statistician sat down to the computer. The parameters make sense only in the context of a model, so the optimization sends around a series of parameterized models, searching for the one that is most likely. In a non-stats setting, you will probably have <code>NULL</code> data, and will be optimizing the parameters internal to the model.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because the unit of analysis is a parameterized model, not just parameters, you need to have an <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a> wrapping your objective function. Here is a typical sort of function that one would maximize; it is Rosenbrock's banana function, <img class="formulaInl" alt="$(1-x)^2+ s(y - x^2)^2$" src="form_91.png"/>, where the scaling factor <img class="formulaInl" alt="$s$" src="form_92.png"/> is fixed ahead of time, say at 100. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct </span>{

You will need to write an <a class="el" href="types_8h.html#aadd13f6aa6f5f17d48d9b7d2b606bdd4">apop_model</a>, which you will send to the optimizer, which is a two step process: write a log likelihood function wrapping the real objective function, and a model that uses that log likelihood.

</pre></div> The <code>.vbase=2</code> specified that your parameters are a vector of size two, which means that <code>in-&gt;parameters-&gt;vector-&gt;data</code> is the list of <code>double</code>s that you should send to <code>banana</code>. The <code>more</code> element of the structure is designed to hold any arbitrary structure; if you use it, you will also need to use the <code>more_size</code> element, as above. Notice that <code>main</code> in this example makes heavy use of standard C designated initializers, because they are wonderful; you may need to tell your compiler to make use of them, such as using the <code>--std=gnu99</code> flag on the <code>gcc</code> command line.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The function is named <em>maximum likelihood</em>, and for computational reasons, it maximizes the log of the likelihood function. You can define your objective function to be either the <code></code>.p or the <code></code>.log_likelihood element of your model, and there is really only one difference: if you give me a <code></code>.p function, I may take its log somewhere along the way. Thus, the value of a <code></code>.p function must always be non-negative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Statisticians want the covariance and basic tests about the parameters. If you just want the optimal value, then adding this line will shut off all auxiliary calculations: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><a class="code" href="group__settings.html#ga553b02de4ace5e6f16a8b26da777f9b9">Apop_model_add_group</a>(your_model, apop_parts_wanted);
</pre></div> See the documentation for <a class="el" href="structapop__parts__wanted__settings.html">apop_parts_wanted_settings</a> for details about how this works. It can also offer quite the speedup: finding the covariance matrix without any information can take maybe 70 evaluations of the objective funtion for each evaluation that is part of the search itself, and thus produce an order-of-magnitude speedup.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MLEs have an especially large number of parameter tweaks that could be made; see the section on MLE settings above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Putting it all together, here is a full program to minimize Rosenbrock's banana function. There are some extras: it uses two methods (notice how easy it is to re-run an estimation with an alternate method, but the syntax for modifying a setting differs from the initialization syntax) and checks that the results are accurate (because this, like most of the code in the documentation, is part of Apophenia's test suite).</li>

<p>The problem is that the parameters of a function must not take on certain values, either because the function is undefined for those values or because parameters with certain values would not fit the real-world problem.</p>
<p>The solution is to rewrite the function being maximized such that the function is continuous at the constraint boundary but takes a steep downward slope. The unconstrained maximization routines will be able to search a continuous function but will never return a solution that falls beyond the parameter limits.</p>
<p>If you give it a likelihood function with no regard to constraints plus an array of constraints, <a class="el" href="group__mle.html#ga29975e75eec9ff9f48e836971a32c925">apop_maximum_likelihood</a> will combine them to a function that fits the above description and search accordingly.</p>
<p>A constraint function must do three things: </p>
<ul>
<li>It must check the constraint, and if the constraint does not bind (i.e. the parameter values are OK), then it must return zero. </li>
<li>If the constraint does bind, it must return a penalty, that indicates how far off the parameter is from meeting the constraint. </li>
<li>if the constraint does bind, it must set a return vector that the likelihood function can take as a valid input. The penalty at this returned value must be zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that if the constraint returns zero, the log likelihood function will return the log likelihood as usual, and if not, it will return the log likelihood at the constraint's return vector minus the penalty. To give a concrete example, here is a constraint function that will ensure that both parameters of a two-dimensional input are both greater than zero:</p>
